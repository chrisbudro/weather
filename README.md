This is a weather app written in Swift 1.2

it's definitely a work in progress.
A project I'm working on to build my proficiency in Swift 

I'm using forecast.io to get current and daily weather forecasts
and Google Places autocomplete to populate location search results

if you try to run the app you will need to add an APIKeys plist and add api keys for both services with the following keys:

"forecast"
"places"
